    "All of computer science is about *abstraction*.\n",

    "- I can take several actions, and wrap them up into a function. \n",
    "- I can take several pieces of data, and wrap them up into a new data structure.\n",

    "Design patterns allow us to apply the principle of abstraction to relationships among objects -- actually, patterns of relationships among objects.  If we see the same relationship in multiple programs, then we can give that relationship a name, and then use it to reason about that relationship in future programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Patterns are about objects and classes, and how we can use them together to solve bigger and more interesting problems. But more importantly, so that we can **communicate** with other people on our team (and elsewhere) about these relationships.\n",

    " - Composition -- one object owns another, or belongs to another.  This is super common in Python, expressed as having an attribute. The object `a` might have an attribute `b`, which we express as `a.b`.  This is composition, with `b` belonging to `a` or (if you prefer) `a` owning `b`.  This is known in the object trade as having a \"has-a\" relationship.  Person has-a name. Car has-a engine size. Book has-a author. Apple has-a price.\n",
    " - Inheritance -- this relationship means that one class is just like another class, with some exceptions. We can express this with the \"is-a\" relationship. The Child class inherits from the Parent class. The Car class inherits from the Vehicle class. We do this because cars are more specific than generic vehicles, but can still get some functionality (data and/or methods) from vehicles.\n",

    " Design patterns are built out of these two relationships.  \n",
